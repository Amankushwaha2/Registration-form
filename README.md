# Employee Enrollment Form

This is a simple web application that allows you to create an employee enrollment form. The form collects basic information about the employee, such as their name, email address, and job title. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: The form includes validation for each field to ensure that the user enters the required information in the correct format. It verifies that the email address is valid and all required fields are filled before submission.

- **Submit Form**: Once all the required information is entered, the user can submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button. The form data is then processed and can be sent to a server for further handling, such as storing it in a database.

## Usage

To use the Employee Enrollment Form, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Fill in the required information in the input fields. The required fields are marked with an asterisk (*) symbol.

4. If any input is invalid or missing, error messages will be displayed next to the respective fields. Make sure to correct the errors before submitting the form.

5. Click the "Submit" button to submit the form. The data can be processed and handled on the server-side as per your requirements.

## Customization

If you want to customize the Employee Enrollment Form, you can modify the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file. You can change the colors, fonts, layout, or any other aspect of the user interface to match your preferences or integrate it into your own project.

You can also customize the form fields and add additional fields as per your specific requirements. Simply modify the HTML structure in the `index.html` file and update the JavaScript validation logic in the `script.js` file accordingly.
